This program computes the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
What is Fibonacci? Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the 
two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes like this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...    
In computer science, recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to 
solve smaller instances of the same problem.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:   
- fib(0) = 0
- fib(1) = 1  

Instructions:
1. Run the program and input different positive integers when prompted.
2. Modify the syntax so that it matches Interactive Practice 11.1
